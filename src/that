/*
Ramesh's basic salary is input through the keyboard. His dearness allowance is 40% of basic salary, and house rent allowance is 20% of basic salary. Write a program to calculate his gross salary.

The program starts by importing the java.util.Scanner package, which allows the user to input data into the program.
Then, it declares three variables of float data type - bs (basic salary), da (dearness allowance), and rh (rent/house allowance).
The program then prompts the user to enter the basic salary by displaying the message "Enter the Basic Salary :". It takes the input using the Scanner object and stores it in the bs variable.
Next, the program calculates the da and rh values using the given formula - DA is 40% of the basic salary (bs*0.4f), and RH is 20% of the basic salary (bs*0.2f).
Finally, the program calculates the total gross salary by adding the bs, da, and rh values and displays the result using the System.out.println() method.

        float bs, da, rh, gs;
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        bs = in.nextFloat();
        da = bs * 0.4f;
        rh = bs * 0.2f;
        gs = bs + da + rh;
        System.out.println("the dearness is " +da);
        System.out.println("the rent house is " +rh);
        System.out.println("the gross is " +gs);
